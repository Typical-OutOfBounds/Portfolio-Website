            <p class="about-item">My name is Aidan and I am a young software engineer and data enthusiast currently studying as a Senior at Michigan State University. Here you will find examples of my work in developing consumer grade applications and data exploration projects. In addition to my resume and work, you might also learn a little about me on the way. <br><br>

                I currently work as an Appilcation Developer with an expected graduation date of May 2023. When Iâ€™m not at work or completing classes, I spend my time leading my fraternity and exploring the campus community. <br><br>
                
                My main personal hobbies are playing video games, going to the gym, and building small personal projects. Some of my favorite recent projects include: <br><br>

                Aim Trainer <br>
